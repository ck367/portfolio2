      Hello my name is Caitanya (J-tan-ya), but everyone calls me Jay for short. I am a computer science graduate from
      the University of Kent, whilst studying I found I had a knack for web development. Once I finished my degree I
      decided I wanted to pursue a career in web development, my goal is to eventually become a full stack developer.
      Every day I am pushing myself to learn something new that can help me with this goal, so far this is where I am.

        <p>I am 23 years old and I live in Canterbury originally from Tenterden. Growing up, like many others I had an
          interest in technology, keeping up to date with it and interacting with it where I could. Eventually when I
          got the chance I built myself my own computer, I quickly became adept at troubleshooting issues with Google.
          My interest in tech led me to pursue a career in computer science; as I was not sure what I specifically
          wanted to do. Whilst at university I found that web assignments interested me more and as such I had an
          easier time completing them, that was when I decided to pursue a career in web development.

      <h2 class="lng-title">Languages I know</h2>
      <div class="job job-1">
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>All the websites I have built of course use HTML. Some projects more than others, for example in my
          fullstack project I mainly used Ruby to build HTML. With each new project my usage of HTML is improving.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="job job-2">
        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>Most of my projects in the past (not hosted) I built using raw CSS as I learnt the fundementals. More
          recently I have built projects using the fron-end framework Bootstrap and for this portfolio website I have
          used node-sass. Node-sass has been a particular delight to work with and learn all the cool tricks that CSS
          can not do.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="job job-3">
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>I have a strong foundation of object orientated programming principles from my time at university. What I
          have learnt at university I have found a lot of cross over into JavaScript; despite varying syntax.
          Additionally I was taught raw JavaScript at university, since then I have made use of the jQuery library and
          node npm for this website.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="job job-4">
        <h3>PHP</h3>
        <p>I have been taught PHP at university, but have put more time into my front end skills to eventually make use
          of what I have built using back end skills. Most notably at university I built a php script which paganated
          an SQL database. I am currently learning Laravel to improve my PHP and back end skills.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="job job-5">
        <h3>SQL</h3>
        <p>Once again the bulk of my learning for SQL was done at university, I had modules combining web and databases
          as well as strict database only ones. I am proficient in database creation, querying and editing on
          relational data. In a more recent project I have used SQL in conjunction with Ruby on Rails.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="job job-6">
        <h3>Ruby</h3>
        <p>Ruby is a newer venture, my fullstack project was built on Amazon Web Services using Ruby on Rails. Using a
          MVC framework such as rails allowed me to quickly build out an application with many features using gems. It
          was a difficult experience at points as the workflow using MVC is quite different.
